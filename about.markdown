Welcome to Regex Meta, the official meta listing of Regex, Manipal.

From tech blogs to paper analysis, Meta gives you insight into the minds of the developers here at Regex. We also use this platform to showcase details about our upcoming events and a summary of those which have passed you by.

At Regex we believe firmly in the concept of **self-exploration** and **self-learning**. Keeping that in mind feel free to clone our repository from Github and dive head first into the code, moulding it into your desired shape.
